We have developed a new tool for inferring the copy number from mixtures of clonal cell populations from whole genome sequencing of tumours. [TITAN](http://compbio.bccrc.ca/software/titan/) has higher sensitivity for identifying subclonal copy number changes compared to existing methods. Using single-cell sequencing, we have validated subclonal events predicted from a high-grade serous ovarian cancer patient. TITAN provides an important advance in comprehensive inference of clonal diversity in cancer genomes. Its application to tumour whole genome sequencing data will enable the study of evolving genome architectures.
