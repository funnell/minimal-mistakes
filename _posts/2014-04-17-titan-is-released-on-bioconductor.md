A new tool, TITAN, developed in the Shah Lab is now available.

TITAN is a tool for predicting subclonal copy number alterations (CNA) and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) from tumour whole genome sequencing data. TITAN infers the clonal cluster of events along with their estimates of cellular prevalence, which is proportion of tumour cells harbouring an event. TITAN also estimates the normal contamination and tumour ploidy.

You can download and install the R package, TitanCNA, from Bioconductor.

See our [TITAN software page](http://compbio-bccrc.sites.olt.ubc.ca/software/titan/) for more details.

Please contact **Gavin Ha (gavin.ha [at] gmail [dot] com)** if you have any questions regarding this software.
